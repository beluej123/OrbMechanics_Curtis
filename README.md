# Orbital Mechanics, Curtis & Vallado mostly

Goals:
1) Build a set of tested tools to develope orbital missions; python examples/problems from Curtis book.
2) Automate the patched conic method.

See full list of references in the file references.py.\
Tool and file development is focused example-by-example from Howard D. Curtis book "Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students".\
Many examples/solutions from David A. Vallado's book "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications", and Braeunig's on-line http://www.braeunig.us/space/interpl.htm , orbital mechanics.

This file collection began with Yitlinn's github work. He developed/tested with Anaconda. Subsequent work done with python 3.11+ and pip install in a virtual environment.

So far (2024-10-11) the required addons are NumPy and Matplotlib.
